      <description>WarmUp with Python Numbers  Open this notebook Make a copy of it in your drive Go through it and execute all cells  In the previous lecture we uploaded data and performed QC. The outcome of this analysis is a set of Illumina reads that are ready to be mapped. Before we map we should understand the theory behind this process.
