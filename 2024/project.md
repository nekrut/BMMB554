# Analysis project

## Project groups

I have subdivided this class into the following groups:

| Group | MEGA plate starting point | Figure in the paper's [supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534434/bin/NIHMS874162-supplement-Supplemental_Methods_And_Figures.pdf) |
|---------|---------------------------|-----|
| 1 | Sym | S3 A |
| 2 | Manifold 4 | S3 B |
| 3 | Manifold 168 | S3 B |
| 4 | Manifold 2 | S3 B |
| 5 | Manifold 5 | S3 B |

These numbers correspond to colony labels in Fig S3 os the [supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534434/bin/NIHMS874162-supplement-Supplemental_Methods_And_Figures.pdf).

## Task 1 
(due March 26, 2024 in class)

1. Go to NCBI SRA
2. Find datasets corresponding to `SRP077287`
3. Download RunInfo table as I showed in class
4. Look at figure S3A (if you are `Sym`) or figure S3B (if you are any of the `Manifold`s)
5. Find a colony corresponding to your number (for `Sym` you can pick any trajectory you like)
6. Write down numbers of colonies corresponding to a progression so that you have a good representatioin of colonies starting from wild type to super-resistant (see image below for an example)
7. Pull rows corresponding to these numbers from RunInfo table (Step 3)
8. Upload this into Galaxy
9. La Fin

Here:

**Start point** - point with the number that was assignewd to your group (e.g., Point 4 for Manifold4)

Now all numbers were sequenced. So you objective is to find adaptation trajectory which has the data in SRA.
