# A quick Python refresher

Python is an essential part of the scientific computing ecosystem (along with R, Julia, and increasingly GO, JavaScript, Rust, etc.). Today we will take a look at most fundamental concepts. Instead of introducing Python in a standard way, we will begin with biologically relevant examples right away. 

We will be playing with the following notebooks today:

- [Strings](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nekrut/BMMB554/blob/master/2021/ipynb/strings.ipynb)
- [DNA as a string](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nekrut/BMMB554/blob/master/2021/ipynb/dna.ipynb)
- [FASTA files](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nekrut/BMMB554/blob/master/2021/ipynb/FASTA.ipynb)
- [FASTQ files](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nekrut/BMMB554/blob/master/2021/ipynb/FASTQ.ipynb)
